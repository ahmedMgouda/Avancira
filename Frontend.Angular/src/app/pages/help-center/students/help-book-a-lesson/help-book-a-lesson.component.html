    <ul class="steps-list">
      <li>
        From the messaging system, click on the button at the bottom right.
      </li>
      <li>
        Offer up to three availabilities. We advise you to offer several dates; your tutor will have more
        choices to schedule a lesson on one of these.
      </li>
      <li>
        Choose the place of the lesson and your means of payment, then validate. No payment will be
        made at the time of the request. The lesson will be paid only if the teacher accepts one of your
        availabilities and the course is scheduled.
      </li>
    </ul>
  
    <p class="details">
      Your tutor will be instantly notified of your request and will choose from one of your availabilities:
    </p>
    <ul class="steps-list">
      <li>The tutor is available, you are notified, and the lesson is scheduled.</li>
      <li>
        They are not available; they will offer you new dates. It will then be your turn to accept their
        proposal.
      </li>
    </ul>

        A messaging service with your tutor is dedicated to you; take the opportunity to discuss your
        availability with them before scheduling the lesson.
