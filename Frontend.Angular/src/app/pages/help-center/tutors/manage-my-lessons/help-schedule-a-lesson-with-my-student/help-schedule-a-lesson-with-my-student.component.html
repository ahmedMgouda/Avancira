      To send a lesson proposal to your student:
    </p>
    <ul class="steps">
      <li>Go to your “My Messages”</li>
      <li>Click “Propose a lesson”</li>
      <li>Offer up to three availabilities (the student will select only one if available)</li>
      <li>Choose the date, time and the lesson location</li>
      <li>Then confirm the lesson</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="closing">
      Your student will receive a notification. If he is not available, he can offer you new dates. 
      It will then be your turn to accept his proposal. You and your student can also refuse the proposals 
      if you cannot find an arrangement.
