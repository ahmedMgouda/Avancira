    <p class="intro">
      With Avancira, you have the possibility of offering several courses at once, at a generally more advantageous price. These are called lesson packs. They can be 5 hours or 10 hours of lessons. You can determine their price in the “Rates” section of the ad.
    </p>
    <p class="description">
      To send a pack proposal to your student:
    </p>
    <ul class="steps">
      <li>Go to your “My Messages”</li>
      <li>Click on “Propose a pack” at the bottom right</li>
      <li>Choose the desired pack (5 hours or 10 hours)</li>
      <li>Check the total price of the pack</li>
      <li>Then confirm the pack</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="closing">
      If your student accepts, you receive 50% of the payment immediately after validation.
